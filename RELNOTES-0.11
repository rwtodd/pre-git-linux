    Linux-0.11 (December 8, 1991)
    
    This was created from a re-packaged 0.11 tree.
    
    Linux-0.11 has a few rather major improvements, but perhaps most
    notably, is the first kernel where some other people start making
    real contributions.
    
     - I fixed the buffer cache code, making it a lot more stable
    
     - demand-loading from disk. My comment proudly states:
    
            Once more I can proudly say that linux stood up to being changed: it
            was less than 2 hours work to get demand-loading completely implemented.
    
       This is a major milestone, since it makes the kernel much more
       powerful than Minix was at the time.  I also share clean pages.
    
     - we still don't have an /sbin/init, but we now load /etc/rc at bootup,
       and the kernel will loop, spawning shells forever. That makes it easier
       to test things.
    
     - scaffolding for math emulation introduced.
    
     - Ted Ts'o shows up as a coder. Ted implements:
            o "#!" escape handling for executables
            o fixes for some file permission handling
            o "sticky" directory bit
            o first "malloc()/free()" implementation.
              (this one is horrible: the free needs the size for good
               performance, which will result in years of "free_s()" pains)
            o adds BSD-style setreuid/gid() handling
            o allows us to specify root device at image build time
            o cleanups of some of the uglier direct %fs-register accesses
    
     - Galen Hunt shows up as a coder: he's added code to handle different
       video card detection (whereas my original one just handled VGA, we
       now handle CGA, MGA, EGA and VGA)
    
     - The console can beep now: John T Kohl (who also does the tty KILL
       char handling)
    
     - we also now have German (Wolfgang Thiel) and French (Marc Corsini)
       keyboard maps.  World Domination!
    
    Btw, if you wonder what the "Urgel" comments are - I was still fairly
    Swedish-speaking, and "Urgel" is what I would these days write as "Ugh".
    
    It's a sign of trouble or ugly code.  The floppy driver in particular is
    clearly not something I'm very proud of ;).
