    Linux 1.0
    
    CHANGES since 0.99 patchlevel 15:
    
    - removed all the bugs, of course.
    - networking fixes.
    - more changes than I really wanted..
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    Linux 1.0---A better UNIX than Windows NT
    
    Summary: Linux 1.0 released
    Keywords: Linux Kernel 1.0 Academy Awards
    X-Moderator-Added-Keywords: universe, end of
    
    Finally, here it is.  Almost on time (being just two years late is
    peanuts in the OS industry), and better than ever:
    
            Linux kernel release 1.0
    
    This release has no new major features compared to the pl15 kernels, but
    contains lots and lots of bugfixes: all the major ones are gone, the
    smaller ones are hidden better.  Hopefully there are no major new ones.
    
    The Linux kernel can be found as source on most of the Linux ftp-sites
    under the names
    
            linux-1.0.tar.gz                (full source)
            linux-1.0.patch.pl15.gz         (patch against linux-0.99pl15)
            linux-1.0.patch.alpha.gz        (patch from linux-pre-1.0)
    
    it should be available at least at the sites
    
            ftp.funet.fi:
                    pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus       (now)
            sunsite.unc.ed:
                    pub/Linux/Incoming              (now)
                    pub/Linux/kernel                (soon)
            tsx-11.mit.edu:
                    pub/linux/sources/system        (soon)
            ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:
                    pub/Software/Linux/Kernel       (now)
    
    This release finally moves Linux out of Beta status and is meant as a
    base for distributions to build on.  It will neither change Linux'
    status as FreeWare under the GPL, nor will it mean the end of
    development on Linux.  In fact many new features where held back for
    later releases so that 1.0 could become a well tested and hopefully
    stable release.
    
    The Linux kernel wouldn't be where it is today without the help of lots
    of people: the kernel developers, the people who did user-level programs
    making linux useful, and the brave and foolhardy people who risked their
    harddisks and sanity to test it all out.  My thanks to you all.
    (Editorial note: if you think this sounds too much like the Academy
    Awards ceremony, just skip this: it's not getting any better.)
    
    Thanks to people like Aaron Kushner, Danny ter Haar and the authors of
    the AnwenderHandbuch (and others) who have helped me with hardware or
    monetary donations (and to the Oxford Beer Trolls and others who took
    care of the drinkware).  And thanks to Dirk, who helped me write this
    announcement despite my lazyness ("hey, it's just another release, who
    needs an announcement anyway?").
    
    To make a long and boring story a bit shorter and boring, here is at
    least a partial list of people who have been helping make Linux what it
    is today.  Thanks to you all,

    pl15b mainly fixes some small tty problems.

Date:   Wed Feb 2 12:00:00 1994 -0800

    pl15a fixes the buffer cache growing problem, adds emulation for a
    few unimportant floating point instructions (i287 instructions that
    are No-Ops on the i387, so "emulating" them is easy :^) and fixes a
    silly bug when mmap'ing stuff write-only.  It also fixes a buggy lock
    in the networking.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.15 (February 2, 1994)
    
    sbpcd (Sound Blaster Pro CD interface) driver.
    
    Andries Brouwer cleans up and re-does keyboard driver diacritical handling.
    
    Lots of new sound drivers.
    
    Sysvfs added (Xenix, SystemV/386 and Coherent support).  Linux was
    starting to have a lot of users move over..
    
    MAP_ANONYMOUS flag added to mmap().
    
    Loadable modules added.
    
    Alan Cox is active in networking.
    
    [original changelog below]
    
    Linux 0.99.15 released: Codefreeze for 1.0
    
    People who look into my directory on ftp.funet.fi will already have
    noticed that the latest version of linux (0.99.15) is available, and I
    assume it will be available on most other linux sites soon.  As
    explained in a previous announcement, 0.99.15 is "it", in that this will
    be the base for 1.0 after about a month of testing.  No further patches
    are accepted until the 1.0 release, unless they obviously fix a serious
    bug.
    
    **** NOTE 1 ****
    
      For this code-freeze to be effective yet still potential bugs be
      found, testing is needed, along with good reports of errors and
      problems.  Thus, nobody should think "hey, the *real* release will be
      out in a month, let's wait for that", but instead think: "hey, I'd
      better test this one, so that the *real* release won't result in any
      ugly surprises for me".
    
      In short: test it out, preferably even more than you usually do.  Run
      "crashme" for the whole month if you have the CPU-power to spare,
      and/or just misuse your machine as badly as you can.  And if there are
      problems, report them to me (and the better the report, the more
      likely I am to be able to do something about it).
    
    **** NOTE 2 ****
    
      Bumping the linux version number to 1.0 doesn't mean anything more
      than that: it's only a version number change.  More explicitly, it
      does *NOT* mean that linux will become commercial (the copyright will
      remain as-is), nor does it mean that development stops here, and that
      1.0 will be anything special in that respect.
    
      I'm also afraid that just changing the version number will not make
      potential bugs magically disappear: this has been amply proven by
      various software houses over the years.  This code-freeze is there in
      order to avoid most of the problems that people sometimes associate
      with "X.0 releases", and I hope that it will mean that we have a
      reasonably stable release that we can call 1.0 and one that I won't
      have to be ashamed of.
    
      Ok, enough said, I hope.  The pl15 release is hopefully good, but I'll
      continue to make ALPHA patches against it along the whole month as
      problems crop up.  The networking code has been much maligned, and is
      not perfect by far yet, but it's getting its act together thanks to
      various developers and testers.  And as wiser men than I have said (or
      if they haven't, they should have):
    
          "There is life after 1.0"
    
      Any rumors that the world is coming to an end just because I'm about to
      release a 1.0-version are greatly exaggerated.  I think.
    
                        Linus
    
    ----------
    Things that remained the same between 0.99.14 and 0.99.15:
    
    - I again forgot to update the README before uploading the release.  In
      pl14, I talked about pl13, while the all new and improved README has
      now caught up with pl14.  Remind me to buy a new brain one of these
      days.
    
    Changes between versions 0.99.14 and 0.99.15:
    
     - improved Pentium detection.  Some of you may have had linux report
       your 4086DX2 as a pentium machine, but the new kernel will tell you
       the sad truth.  Whee.
     - Network driver updates by Donald Becker.  New drivers added, old ones
       updated.
     - FPU emulation updates by Bill Metzenthen.  Various minor errors and
       misfeatures fixed (mostly error handling).
     - Support for the SoubdBlaster Pro CD-ROM driver added by Eberhard
       Moenkeberg.
     - extended support for keyboard re-definition, along with font
       re-programming (Eugene Crosser, Andries Brouwer et al).
     - tty handling fixes: true canonical mode with most features supported
       by Julian Cowley.  This may make your canonical mode behave funnily
       if you happen to use old and broken programs that happened to work
       with the old and broken behaviour (this includes at least some
       'getty' programs).
     - serial driver changes and tty fixes by Theodore Ts'o.
     - SCSI fixes by Drew Eckhardt, Eric Youngdale, Rik Faith, Kai Mdkisara
       et al.
     - Updated sound card driver to version 2.4 (Hannu Savolainen)
     - COFF binary loading support (but you will still need the experimental
       iBCS2 patches to run non-linux i386 COFF binaries) by Al Longyear.
     - Upgraded ext2fs filesystem routines (0.4a -> 0.4b), with new
       features.  Read the fs/ext2/CHANGES file for details.  Remy Card and
       Stephen Tweedie.  Get a new fsck that knows about the new features.
     - pipe behaviour fixed in the presense of multiple writers (now
       actually conforms to POSIX specs about atomic writes).  Much of the
       code by Florian Coosmann.
     - minix filesystem extended to support the clean flag: get a new fsck
       that knows about it.
     - System V filesystem (support for Xenix, Coherent and SysV
       filesystems) by Doug Evans, Paul Monday, Pascal Haible and Bruno
       Haible.
     - loadable modules (various authors, don't remember original author of
       the "modules" code).
     - Lots of networking fixes by various people: Alan Cox, Charles
       Hedrick, me and various other people.  Non-byte-aligned networks
       work, and the networking code should be much stabler in general.
    
     + various bugfixes and enhacements here and there (mcd driver update by
       Jon Tombs, atixlmouse fix by Chris Colohan, /dev/full by XXX etc etc)
    
    All in all, the patches come out to 1.5MB uncompressed (about 400kB
    gzip-9'd), so there is little or no idea to make patches to plain pl14
    available.  Incremental patches and ALPHA-releases can be found on
    ftp.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/ALPHA-pl14.

Date:   Sun Nov 28 12:00:00 1993 -0800

    This is a general announcement of the imminent code-freeze that will
    hopefully make linux 1.0 a reality.  The plan has been discussed a bit
    with various developers already, and is already late, but is still in
    effect otherwise.
    
    In short, the next version of linux (0.99.15) will be a "full-featured"
    release, and only obvious bug-fixes to existing features will be applied
    before calling it 1.0.  If this means that your favourite feature or
    networking version won't make it, don't despair: there is life even
    after beta (and it's probably not worth mailing me about it any more:
    I've seen quite a few favourite features already ;-).
    
    In fact, 1.0 has little "real meaning", as far as development goes, but
    should be taken as an indication that it can be used for real work
    (which has been true for some time, depending on your definition of
    "real work").  Development won't stop or even slow down: some of it has
    even been shelved pending a 1.0 already.
    
    Calling it 1.0 will not necessarily make all bugs go away (quite the
    opposite, judging by some other programs), but I hope it will be a
    reasonably stable release.  In order to accomplish this, the code-freeze
    after 0.99.15 will be about a month, and I hope people will test out
    that kernel heavily, instead of waiting for "the real release" so that
    any potential bugs can be found and fixed.
    
    As to where we are now: as of this moment, the latest release is the 'r'
    version of pl14 (aka "ALPHA-pl14r").  I've made ALPHA releases available
    on ftp.funet.fi almost daily, and expect a final pl15 within a few more
    days.  Testing out the ALPHA releases is not discouraged either if you
    like recompiling kernels every day or two..
    
    And finally: we also try to create a "credits" file that mentions the
    developers of the kernel and essential linux utilities.  The credit file
    compilator is jmartin@opus.starlab.csc.com (John A. Martin), and if you
    feel you have cause to be mentioned in it, please contact him.

Date:   Sun Sep 19 11:00:00 1993 -0800

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.13 (September 19, 1993)
    
    We get enable_irq()/disable_irq()
    
    The C++ experiment is not going well.  Get rid of the 'extern "C"', but
    replace it with an "asmlinkage" #define that allows us to experiment.
    
    ELF binary support it a notable change.
    
    Original ChangeLog:
    
     - the bad memory management one-liner bug in pl12 is naturally fixed.
     - compiled with plain C by default instead of C++
     - ELF binary support (Eric Youngdale)
     - Quickport mouse support (and some changes to the PS/2 mouse driver)
       by Johan Myreen and co)
     - core file name change ("core" -> "core.xxxx" where xxxx is the name
       of the program that dumped code).  Idea from ???.  Also, core-files
       now correctly truncate any existing core file before being written.
     - some mmap() fixes: better error returns, and handling of non-fixed
       maps for /dev/mem etc.
     - one kludgy way to fix the wrong arp packets that have plagued net-2d
       (resulting in arp packets that had the first four bytes of the
       ethernet address as the IP address).
     - I fixed the mount-point handling of 'rename()' and 'unlink()/rmdir()'
       so that they should now work and/or give appropriate error messages.
       An early version of this patch was already sent to the KERNEL
       channel, which fixed the rename problem but not a similar bug with
       unlink.
     - packet mode fixes by Charles Hedrick.  Sadly, these are likely to
       break old telnet/rlogin binaries, but it had to be done in order to
       communicate correctly with the rest of the world.
     - FPU emulator patches from Bill Metzenthen.  The fprem1 insn should be
       correct now (not that anybody seems to have seen the incorrect
       behaviour..)
     - a few fixes for SCSI (Drew and Eric)
     - signal.c changes to handle multiple segments (for Wine) correctly.
     - updated drivers from Donald Becker: 3c509 and AT1500 drivers, but
       also some other drivers have been edited, and some networking fixes.

Date:   Sat Aug 14 11:00:00 1993 -0800

    Very small patch to 0.99pl12
    
    I hate to put out patches this soon after a release, but there is one
    potentially major problem in pl12 which is very simple to fix..  I'm
    including patches: both in plain ascii and as a uuencoded gzip file
    (it's the same patch - the uuencoded one is in case there is any
    newsserver that messes up whitespace).
    
    The main patch is just the change from __get_free_page(GFP_BUFFER) into
    get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL), and the two minor patches just add checks
    that actually enforce the read-only nature of current file mmap'ings so
    that any program that tries to do a write mapping at least will be told
    that it won't work.
    
    I'd suggest anybody compiling pl12 should add at least the file_table.c
    patch: thanks to Alexandre Julliard for noticing this one.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.12 (August 14, 1993)
    
    CDU31A and MCD CD-ROM drivers.  Ahh, the bad old days of every sound
    card manufacturer having their own CD interface.
    
    Much nicer keymaps for keyboards.
    
    Many more network drivers by Donald Becker for the improving NET-2 code.
    
    Eric Youngdale makes executables and libraries use the new mmap()
    functionality.  The old special-cased sharing goes away.  Hurray! This
    also means that mmap gets a lot more testing.  It also means that NFS
    has to be fixed to allow mmaps. Done.
    
    "sys_modify_ldt()" appears, the extended DOS emulators want it.
    
    Still using C++ to compile the kernel.
    
    Original changelog:
    
     - The memory manager cleanup has continued, and seems to be mostly
       ready, as proven by the ease of adding mmap() over NFS with the new
       routines.  So yes, the pl12 kernel will demand-load your binaries
       over NFS, sharing code and clean data, as well as running shared
       libraries over NFS.  Memory management by Eric and me, while the NFS
       mmap code was written by Jon Tombs,
    
     - ** IMPORTANT **: The keyboard driver has been enhanced even further,
       and almost everything is completely re-mappable.  This means that
       there is a new version of 'loadkeys' and 'dumpkeys' that you must use
       with this kernel or you'll have problems.  The default keyboard is
       still the US mapping, but if you want to create your own mappings
       you'll have to load them with the new binaries.  Get the 'kbd.tar.gz'
       archive from the same place you get the kernel.
    
       The new keymappings allow things like function key string changes,
       remapping of the control keys, and freedom to remap any of the normal
       keyboard functions: including special features like rebooting,
       console switching etc.  The keyboard remapping code has been done
       mostly by Risto Kankkunen (Risto.Kankkunen@Helsinki.FI).
    
     - updated network drivers by Donald Becker
    
     - updated serial drivers - tytso@Athena.mit.edu
    
     - updated 387 emulation (Bill Metzenthen).  The updated emulator code
       has more exact trigonometric functions and improved exception
       handling.  It now behaves very much like a real 486, with only small
       changes (greater accuracy, slightly different denormal NaN handling
       etc - hard to detect the differences even if you are looking for
       them).
    
     - network timer fixes by Florian La Roche (much cleaned up net/inet/timer.c
       and some bad race-conditions fixed).
    
     - Scsi code updates by Eric Youngdale and others
    
     - Sony CDU-31A CDROM driver by Corey Minyard added to the standard
       kernel distribution.
    
     - The Mitsumi CDROM driver is now part of the standard kernel.  Driver
       by Martin Harriss with patches by stud11@cc4.kuleuven.ac.be (yes, he
       probably has a real name, but no, I haven't found it) and Jon Tombs.
    
     - various other minor patches (preliminary ldt support etc)

    PATCH: fork.c bug in 0.99.pl11
    
    There is at least one known problem with 0.99pl11 - it's very minor and
    will not lead to any real problems, but it's also very easy to fix,
    so...
    
    The problem is a one-liner oversight in kernel/fork.c (thanks to TjL for
    noticing the symptoms - they aren't easy to see), which is fixed by the
    following patch:
    
    In fact, it's probably easiest to "apply" this patch by hand: just
    change the "p->tss.fs = KERNEL_DS" in fork.c to "p->tss.fs = USER_DS"
    and you should be fine.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.11 (July 17, 1993)
    
    Real file mmap with page sharing in the VM code.  We don't do writable
    shared mappings (and we won't do them for a _long_ time yet), but this
    is a big step forward!
    
    Note in the COPYING file that the GPL only covers the kernel, not user
    programs. People were starting to find Linux more and more interesting..
    
    Improved configure script.
    
    Use nicer "save_flags()/cli()/restore_flags()" macros instead of
    hardcoding the inline assembly.  Clean up other inline assembly usage
    too.
    
    Trying to compile the kernel with C++ compiler.  It will be a failed
    experiment.
    
    Original ChangeLog:
    
     - The keyboard is dynamically changeable (this is true of pl10 as
       well), and you need to get the "keytables.tar.z" archive to set the
       keyboard to suit your taske unless you want to live with the default
       US keymaps.
    
       Use the "loadkeys map/xxx.map" command to load the keyboard map: you
       can edit the maps to suit yourself if you can't find a suitable one.
       The syntax of the keyboard maps should be obvious after looking at
       the examples.
    
     - The memory manager has been cleaned up substantially, and mmap()
       works for MAP_PRIVATE.  MAP_SHARED is still not supported for
       anything else than /dev/mem, but even so it actually is usable for a
       lot of applications.  The shared library routines have been rewritten
       to use mmap() instead of the old hardcoded behaviour.
    
     - The kernel is now compiled with C++ instead of plain C.  Very few
       actual C++ features are used, but even so C++ allows for more
       type-checking and type-safe linkage.
    
     - The filesystem routines have been cleaned up for multiple block
       sizes.  None of the filesystems use it yet, but people are working on
       it.
    
     - named pipes and normal pipes should hopefully have the right select()
       semantics in the presense/absense of writers.
    
     - QIC-02 tape driver by Hennus Bergman
    
     - selection patches in the default kernel
    
     - fixed a bug in the pty code which led to busy waiting in some
       circumstances instead of sleeping.
    
     - Compressed SLIP support (Charles Hedrick). See net/inet/CONFIG
    
     - the 'clear_bit()' function was changed to return the previous setting
       of the bit instead of the old "error-code".  This makes use of the
       bit operations more logical.
    
     - udelay() function for short delays (busy-waiting) added.  Used
       currently only by the QIC driver.
    
     - fork() and sheduler changes to make task switches happen only from
       kernel mode to kernel mode.  Cleaner and more portable than the old
       code which counted on being able to task-switch directly into user
       mode.
    
     - debugging malloc code.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.10 (June 7, 1993)
    
    People finally gave up on net-1, Ross Biro grew tired of the flames, and
    net-2 appears with Fred van Kempen as maintainer.  This is the big
    switch-over version.
    
    fsync() isn't just a stub any more, and System V IPC is also showing up.
    
    The "struct file" filetable is made dynamic, instaed of a static
    allocation.  For the first time you can have _lots_ of files open.
    
    Stub for iBCS2 emulation code.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    I've finally released an official version of linux-0.99 patchlevel 10:
    there have been various alpha versions floating around which differ in
    details (notably networking code), which shouldn't be used any more.
    The new linux version is available only as full source code: the diffs
    would have been too big to be useful.  You can find linux-0.99.10.tar.z
    (along with keytables.tar.z) on nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus
    and probably on tsx-11 and other linux archives within a day or two (so
    check there first if you are in the states).
    
    Linux-0.99 pl10 has a number of new features and changes in interface.
    The most notable of these are:
    
     - the networking code is reorganized (generally called "net-2",
       although unrelated to the BSD release).  The new code implements a
       lot of standard features lacking in net-1, and also changes the user
       interface to be closer to the BSD standards.  Notably, the old
       configuration binaries won't work, so to get the new networking to
       work you'll have to get the net-2 binaries as well.  The networking
       binaries are available on tsx-11.mit.edu (and mirrors) under the
       directory pub/linux/packages/net/net-2 (and the setup syntax has
       changed somewhat..)
    
       The networking code has been mainly organized and rewritten by Fred
       van Kempen, with drivers by Donald Becker.
    
     - serial line setup has been changed: linux 0.99 pl10 does *not* try to
       autodetect serial ports very agressively.  If you have other serial
       ports than the standard com1/com2, or nonstandard IRQ etc values,
       this means that it's less likely to work without any help.  The
       solution is not to recompile the kernel - you should get the
       "setserial" program available from tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory
       pub/linux/sources/sbin/setserial-2.01.tar.z that allows you to
       dynamically configure your serial ports to suit your setup.
    
       The main organizer behind the serial line changes is tytso (Theodore
       Ts'o).
    
     - Keyboard setup has changed: it is no longer hardcoded at compile
       time, but instead you can use the new "loadkeys" program to load in a
       new keyboard map on the fly.  The default keyboard map is the normal
       US keyboard (yes, I should have used the Finnish one by default, but
       after thinking of all the problems that would have resulted in I
       forgot about that idea).  The loadkeys code can be found in the
       "keytables.tar.z" archive, which also contains keymaps for most
       normal keyboard types.  To create a custom keyboard table is very
       easy - just take a 5 minute look at the existing map files (they
       resemble the ones used by xmodmap, so if you are familiar with
       those..)
    
       The loadable keymaps were mostly implemented by Risto Kankkunen.
    
    There are a lot of other internal kernel changes, but they should be
    mostly transparent, and noticeable only indirectly due to new features
    or (hopefully) better/faster/whatever operation.  These include:
    
     - the SysV IPC patches are in by default: Krishna Balasubramanian.
       If you need these, you know what it's about (notably, dosemu 0.49
       wants them).
     - inode handling is updated: inodes and files are now dynamically
       allocated within the kernel, and use a hash table for faster lookup
       (along with a NFU algorithm for the inode cache).  Steven Tweedie.
     - Updated FPU emulation: mostly exception handling changes, making the
       emulator handle most exceptions the same way a 486 does.  The
       emulator is written by Bill Metzenthen.
     - a few ext2-fs updates by Remy Card and Steven Tweedie.
     - support for the 'fsync()' function (Steven Tweedie)
     - various (minor) SCSI patches to catch some error conditions, add
       support for VLB adaptec controllers without DMA and so on (different
       people).
     - other changes - I forget.
    
    In addition to patches sent in by others, I've naturally made my own
    changes (often *to* the patches sent in by others :-).  Among other
    things, the pl10 buffer cache code now also tries to share pages with
    executables, resulting in better cacheing especially of binaries (giving
    noticeable improvements in kernel recompilation speed on some machines).
    Also, I've changed a lot of low-level things around to help the iBCS2
    project: this includes things like internal segment handling and the
    signal stack (which now looks the same as on SysV i386 unixes).  All in
    all, pl10 has a disturbing amount of new code, but will hopefully work
    well despite (due to?) the number of changes.
    
    The new networking code in particular will change the network setup a
    lot - it now looks more standard, but if you were used to the old way of
    doing things..  On the other hand, most people actively using the
    networking features have hopefully gotten warnings about this on the NET
    channel for the last few weeks.  Also, the networking code still isn't
    perfect: Fred is still working on it, but it seems to have reached a
    reasonably stable platform on which it will be easier to build.  Look
    out for the new-and-improved networking manual, hopefully out soon(?).
    
    Standard request: please try it all out, give it a real shakedown, and
    send comments/bug-reports to the appropriate place (I'm always
    appropriate, but you may want to send the report to the mailing lists
    and/or the newsgroup as well).  I apologize for the lateness of the
    release (forcing hlu to make interim gcc releases that relied on
    nonstandard kernels etc), and the changes are somewhat bigger than I'd
    prefer, so the more testerts that try it out, the faster we can try to
    fix any possible problems.  The new kernel has gone through various
    stages of ALPHA-diffs and some late ALPHA-pl10's, so there shouldn't be
    any major surprises, but alpha releases tend not to get even close to
    the coverage a real release gets...

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.9 (April 23, 1993)
    
    Bill's math emulator now passes paranoia.
    
    Last argument to ioctl is "long".
    
    sys_clone() appears.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    The latest kernel release is 0.99.9, and can be found on nic.funet.fi:
    pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus, both as patches relative to pl8 and as full
    sources.  The only major new feature is that the ST-0x driver has
    finally been updated to the scatter-gather code: ST-0x users should with
    luck get about 5 times the performance on disk-operations..  Seagate
    code written by Drew Eckhardt.
    
    0.99.9 also fixes:
    - the FPU-emulator should now handle all rounding-modes correctly, and
      pass all the paranoia package tests.  Patches by Bill Metzenthen.
    - bootup enhancements by Chrisoph Niemann (but the SVGA mode numbers
      have changed, so you may have to edit your lilo configuration file
      and/or the main Makefile to get the mode you normally want)
    - ext2fs updated to the very latest release.  Code by Remy Card and
      Stephen Tweedie.
    - various minor patches, some of them cosmetic, some of them fixes to
      smaller bugs..  Thanks to everybody who sent them in (even though not
      all made it)
    
    It might be a good idea to test it all out,

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.8 (April 8, 1993)
    
    Mount root filesystem read-only (conditional for now).
    
    SCSI updates.
    
    Stephen Tweedie shows up in ext2, with an enhanced block allocator.
    
    Signal handling update with generated code on the stack and a
    "sigreturn" system call.  This was needed to maintain compatibility in
    the face of a changed stack layout.  sigsuspend() also works correctly now.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    Yet another kernel release is now available on nic.funet.fi in the usual
    place (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus for those of you that have already
    forgotten), and will probably show up on the other ftp-sites within a
    day or two.  There are two new files:
    
     linux-0.99.8.tar.z - the full gzipped and tarred source-tree of the
       linux kernel.
    
     linux-0.99.patch8.z - unified diffs against the last official release
       (0.99pl7).
    
    There is no SLIP or new networking routines in this kernel despite the
    rumors that have been flying around - the main changes to 0.99.7 are
    (some of them were in 0.99pl7A as well):
    
    - the signal handling code has been extensively reworked, and should be
      POSIX as well as clean.
    - dosfs is upgraded to version 12 (Werner Almesberger)
    - xiafs is upgraded to the latest version (Qi Xia)
    - ext2fs is upgraded to the latest version (Remy Card/Stephen Tweedie)
    - FPU-emulation patches for v86 mode and precision rounding (Bill
      Metzenthen)
    - SCSI patches by various people (Eric Youngdale & co)
    - XT harddisk support (Pat Mackinlay)
    - new trial code to try to handle 387 lockups on some systems more
      gracefully.
    - keyboard, lp and serial driver fixes
    - various minor changes (mounting root read-only, bootup messages
      cleaned up etc)
    
    As always, comments/bugs etc are encouraged,

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.7A (March 21, 1993)
    
    More net-1 work. It's endless.
    
    XT harddisk support by Pat Mackinlay.
    
    sys_fsync() and SysV IPC code sys_ipc() stubs appear.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    I don't generally announce ALPHA-diffs to quite this large an audience,
    but I'll be partying^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hunavailable for the rest of the
    week, and it's unlikely that I will be able to check mails or the
    newsgroups until the start of April.  As a result, I'm putting up my
    latest kernel version for ftp as it fixes some things in 0.99.7.
    
    The ALPHA-diffs can be found on nic.funet.fi: in the directory
    pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus.  If you dislike patching, you can get the
    full sources in "linux-0.99.7A.tar.z", or just get the diff file
    "ALPHA-diff.z".
    
    Changes in this release:
    - the new kernel now detects the lock-up condition at startup if you
      have a faulty 386/387 coupling, and will use software floating point
      in that case.
    - the Xia filesystem is updated to the latest version
    - the DOS filesystem is updated to the latest version
    - the XT disk driver is included: I haven't been able to test it, but
      at least it won't bother anybody if you don't configure it in..
    - the latest serial diffs are in
    - minor ultrastor fixes
    - some changes to the keyboard and line printer drivers: I hope the
      keyboard lockups that some people have reported would be gone with
      this release.
    - some fixes to arp.c
    
    I'll be interested in success/failure reports, although I won't be able
    to answer them for some time (and I might miss some of the posts on
    c.o.l).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.7 (March 13, 1993)
    
    Nigel Gamble makes lp driver able to use interrupts.
    
    The mmap() code is finally starting to really happen.  In particular,
    this means that "verify_area()" is doing more - it can check the actual
    areas that have been mapped, rather than just blindly assume that the
    user can access anything in the first 3GB.
    
    For now, the mmap code only does anonymous mappings and /dev/mem.
    Executables are still read into memory.  But the infrastructure is
    there.
    
    The VFS layer stops using names directly in user space - the race
    conditions were just too hard to handle.  So pathnames are copied into
    kernel space before they are looked up.
    
    Ext2fs (Remy Card) and xiafs (Frank Xia) are merged.  Both are much
    faster filesystems using bitmaps rather than freelists, and can handle
    big disks and big files.
    
    Ext2fs is based on extfs, while xiafs is a simpler straightforward
    extension of the old minixfs.
    
    Xiafs obviously was eventually dropped.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    It has been two weeks since the last release, so it's high time you
    should once more enjoy the pleasures of patching up your kernel to a
    higher version number if you are into those kinds of perversions.  Linux
    0.99pl7 is available as both full source and diffs against pl6 on
    nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus, and it will probably show up on
    the other major sites within days.
    
    As of pl7, I'm trying out a new format: both the full distribution and
    the diffs are now compressed with gzip as it is now available at most
    machines.  Also, the diffs are no longer context diffs: they use the
    smaller unified diff format.  At least the stock SunOS 'patch' binary
    seems not to understand them at all, but GNU patch has no problems, and
    unified diffs are a bit smaller (not that it matters much after gzip has
    done its deed on them).
    
    As to the changes in pl7: they are many and varied, and hopefully all to
    the better (-"Dream on Linus" -"Shut up").  Short list follows, hope I
    haven't forgotten anything major.
    
     - ext2fs is in: note that this is version 0.2c and that if you are
       currently using an older version there are some changes.  Small
       filesystems (< 256MB) should reportedly be automatically converted,
       bigger filesystems need some assistance. Ext2fs written by Remy Card.
     - xiafs is also in: again, the final version uses a slightly different
       layout to support exact file block counts, so if you use the xiafs,
       you should make sure you have the latest fs-tools.  Xiafs written by
       Frank Xia.
     - updated Ultrastor SCSI driver with scatter/gather by Scott Taylor.
       It should be much faster, as well as support the Ultrastor-34F.
     - major changes in the memory manager.  Yours truly got carried away,
       and finally cleaned up the mm layer due to pmacdona wanting mmap() on
       /dev/zero.  This means that the IPC patches won't go in, and need
       updating.  Krishna?
     - more big changes: I rewrote most of the VFS filename-handling.
       Filenames are copied into kernel space before being used, which
       cleaned things up somewhat, as well as simplifying some race-
       condition handling.  As a result, I was also able to easily expand
       the minix fs to cover the "linux" fs that some people have been using
       (same layout, but with 30-character names).
     - updated the printer driver: Nigel Gamble.  It is now able to use
       interrupts, although the default behaviour is still to poll.
     - serial driver updates by tytso (but no SLIP yet)
     - various minor patches for POSIX compliace: Bruce Evans, Rick Sladkey
       and me.
     - other minor patches all over the place: scsi, tcpip etc.
    
    All in all, the patches are almost half a megabyte even as unified
    diffs: getting the full sources might be easier than patching it all up.
    
    As always, some of the patches are actually tested by me, some aren't
    (and just because I wrote some of them doesn't mean I actually *tested*
    them: I have no idea if mmap() works on /dev/zero, although it should).
    I have neither a printer nor an Ultrastor controller, and I haven't got
    the diskspace to test out the new filesystems, so I can only hope they
    work "as advertized".  If you have problems, I want to hear about them,
    so keep the reports coming, and try to pinpoint the problem as well as
    you can ("when I do *this* it happens every time..").

    I'm starting soon to run out of patchlevel numbers for 0.99, but I made
    a new release anyway (and long-time linux hackers remember my less than
    completely logical numbering: when I run out of numbers I'll start using
    alphabetical characters and other fun characters to indicate new
    versions :-)
    
    0.99pl6 is mainly a syncronization release: it fixes a few bugs and
    changes the behaviour of 'vhangup()' to be more standard.  The vhangup()
    changes will break some init/login stuff that depended on the earlier
    incorrect behaviour - not everybody may want to use pl6 until you are
    sure your init/login will work happily with it.  Better do these things
    before 1.0 than to break it later.
    
    Patchlevel 6 also changes the vfs functions for special devices as well
    as adding a 'fsync' field to the inode-operations structure.  Thus
    ext2fs and xfs need updating.  Remy and Xia? The special file and fifo
    handling code is no longer supposed to be in the fs-dependent layer, but
    is handled by the vfs routines, as it's the same for all "normal"
    filesystems.
    
    Ok, here are the actual changes/features of pl6:
    - the kernel can be loaded in gzipped format and de-compressed at
      startup beyond the 1MB mark.  Good for bootable rootdisks.  Patches
      mainly by Hannu Savolainen.
    - I finally enabled NMI's everywhere (except at the bootup sequence),
      so if you have memory errors, they will hopefully now result in
      kernel messages ("NMI received..")
    - the device registration code for special devices.  Special files are
      now registered with a special "register_[chr|blk]dev()" function.
    - consolidated fifo/special dev handling
    - vhangup patches.  Note that these may break init/login badly, at
      least if you are using poeigl-1.7.  Be careful that you don't get
      totally locked out of your machine.
    - the procfs NULL-dereferencing bugfix (michaelkjohnson)
    - literal next character handling (very losely based on a patch I
      received: I essentially rewrote it with final fixes by jrs).
    - fpu-emu bugfixes by Bill Metzenthen - fixes the "internal error 112"
      bug as well as a sign bug with zero.
    - fdomain driver fixes
    - various other minor fixes (wrongly replying to bad ip messages etc)
    
    I'm still not sure about the 387 error detection code: I have had a
    couple of messages that would suggest that some early clone 387's have
    problems with math exceptions in protected mode.  With the new (as of
    99pl5) test at startup this can lead to problems at boot-time.  Please
    mail me directly if you seem to have problems with this (it should be
    obvious in pl6 due to debugging messages at startup).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.5 (February 9, 1993)
    
    net-1: more fixes, use bottom halves for transmitting, more "volatiles"
    to hide bugs. /proc interfaces for networking.
    
    Side note: it took networking a _long_ time to recover from the
    volatiles.  Getting the locking right rather than trying to make the
    compiler make races smaller was a hard idea to get through.
    
    Bill Metzenthen moves his math emulator to "beta 1.0" status.
    
    Fred van Kempen shows up: starting to do a SLIP line discipline for tty
    devices.
    
    Verify FP exception handling.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
            "He's done it yet again - doesn't he ever rest?"
                            - anonymous linux kernel hacker
    
    Only complete newbies don't know what this is all about, but I'd better
    tell you anyway: patchlevel 5 of the 0.99 kernel is now available on
    nic.funet.fi (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus) as both context diffs against
    pl4 and complete source code.  I'm not even going to speculate on 1.0
    right now.
    
    The pl5 diffs are about 90kB compressed: the major changes are to the
    tcp/ip code and the serial driver, while there are various minor fixes
    strewn around the system:
    
     - serial lines/tty changes (tytso & Fred v Kempen)
     - NFS bugfixes (Rick Sladkey)
     - tcp/ip (Ross Biro)
     - coprocessor handling changes (me)
     - harddisk driver error handling (Mika Liljeberg)
     - various minor patches (me and others)
    
    Serial lines now implement non-blocking opens correctly and support
    dial-out lines (same minor, major==5).  I changed the default startup
    mode to be CLOCAL so that people won't get confused by the modem line
    code when not using dial-in.
    
    Another interesting change is the 387 error-coupling tests at bootup:
    the code to check if the intel-recommended exception 16 error reporting
    is present is "non-obvious".  If you have had problems with coprocessor
    error handling, or have a non-intel coprocessor, I'd suggest you test
    this out: I'd like to hear about problems/successes.
    
                    Linus
    
    PS.  If you tested out the latest ALPHA-diffs (the ones that already
    changed the kernel version to pl5), the changes to the final pl5 were
    only cosmetic.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.4 (January 20, 1993)
    
    net-1: random addition of "volatile" keywords to try to hide race
    conditions in the code.
    
    File locking updated with shared and exclusive locks for BSD flock.
    
    Re-mounting of filesystems and new mount system call.

    Get pl4, and it should be gone.  There was a bug in the handling of
    uninitialized interrupts in pl3, where they could result in either the
    wrong interrupt mask being loaded leading to interrupt lock-out or (in
    some cases) bit corruption at the user level.  The symptoms are exactly
    as you describe: a good interrupt that didn't happen to be locked out
    will correct the interrupt mask, and the system goes on (it can be
    moving the mouse, but it might also be a keyboard event etc).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.3 (January 13, 1993)
    
    VFS gets "permission()" virtual function.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Still no 1.0 - I have had a couple of reports of problems, so I'll make
    yet another 0.99 release.  The diffs (against 0.99.2) and complete
    source can be found at nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus as usual,
    and will probably show up at the other sites pretty soon.
    
    0.99.3 contains no real new features, but the diffs are pretty big
    anyway (100kB+ compressed): various things have moved around a bit and
    there are a lot of minor changes.  The changes include (but are not
    limited to):
    
     - the math emulator code now also understands the unofficial codes (in
       case somebody followed the ML math emulator thread).  I'd be
       interested to hear whether ML now works with the emulator.
     - various SCSI driver changes
     - some re-organization of the tty open/close code to remove a few race
       conditions.
     - interrupt handling rewrites (two-level interrupt code cleanups)
     - the serial drivers are tytso's alpha-drivers: they aren't quite
       completed, but as they need the interrupt handling patches to get
       ready, this is probably the least traumatic way of doing it.
     - some more minor keyboard driver changes (mostly taking advantage of
       the two-level interrupts)
    
    + a lot of other minor changes.  I once more hope people will try it
    out, and report any problems or successes to me.
    
    Known problems:
     - there seems to be something weird going on in the ST-0x driver with
       some scsi disks.
     - tcp/ip is reportedly still not quite stable, and I can't even test it
       out.
    
    NOTE! The DMA functions have changed for the high DMA channels - all DMA
    functions now take their arguments as the number of bytes instead of the
    old way of using bytes for ch 0-3 and words for ch 5-7.  This might lead
    to problems with the SoundBlaster driver, which may need editing.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.2 (January 1, 1993)
    
    Bottom half race condition fix.
    
    Return ENODEV for nonexistent special devices.
    
    Fix Unix domain sockets to properly check for target equality.
    
    Add 'wchan' to /proc/stat
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Yes, as you've probably noticed, it's now 1993 and I still haven't
    released 1.0.  Sorry about that, and I have only another patchlevel to
    offer.  The new kernel should mainly fix some of the keyboard problems
    people have experienced, but does contain some other minor fixes.
    
    Linux 0.99.2 is available now at nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus
    as both sources and diffs against 0.99.1 the diffs are essentially the
    same as the second alpha-diffs I released for limited testing, with only
    minor fixes to fs/exec.c and fs/open.c.
    
    Please try out 0.99.2: the more feedback (hopefully positive) I get on
    it, the faster 1.0 will be out.
    
    Changes from pl1 are mainly:
     - pretty much rewritten low-level keyboard handling IO - this time
       actually trying to do it by the book.  It now handles resend requests
       from the keyboard etc.
     - you can run executables from filesystems without bmap support.  This
       mainly means NFS and msdos.  Note that while it's possible, it's
       slower and less memory-efficient than using a "normal" linux
       filesystem, and should generally be avoided.
     - /proc filesystem changes: /proc/kmsg can be used to log the kernel
       messages under X11 (instead of using the older system call to do the
       same), and there are changes to the statistics routines (WCHAN).
    
    + various minor fixes (non-existent devices are handled better, some
    changes to socket bind behaviour etc).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.1 (December 21, 1992)
    
    Patch 1 addresses the following problems:
     - configuration. Hope there are no silly problems left..
     - inode.c: initialization changes (the missing NULL and some other
       minor fixes).
     - some SCSI tape driver patches (Kai M{kisara)
     - tcp/ip patches (Ross Biro, some code by me)
     - keyboard patches (mainly changed initialization - hope the keyboard
       lockups are gone).
     - completed /proc-fs: it should now contain all info needed by 'ps'
       (Micheal K Johnson).
     - various minor fixes (the minix-fs link overflow checking etc)
    
    Patch1 also contains support for extended VC switching - this is for the
    upcoming X11 that understands VC's.  One result of this is that console
    redirection now redirects *only* messages actually sent to /dev/console
    (aka /dev/tty0), not just to any foreground VC.  Wait for Xfree-1.2 to
    be able to switch VC's while under X (yes, including several X-sessions
    active at the same time..).
    
    I hope there are still people out there that aren't too busy stuffing
    themself with turkey to try out a new kernel release.  There is just
    over a week left of this year, and I need feedback in order to be able
    to release 1.0.
    
                    Linus
    
    PS.  Thanks to everybody who has sent me Christmas/New Year/Birthday
    cards.  Some contained money, some didn't, and I enjoyed them all.
    Thanks.
