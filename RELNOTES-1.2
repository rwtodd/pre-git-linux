(I couldn't find anything official... but here's an excerpt from a Linux
Journal Article)

Tuesday, March 7, 1995, Linus Torvalds released Linux 1.2.0, also called “Linux
'95”, little less than a year after his release of the ground-breaking Linux
1.0. In his announcement, Linus pointed out an important difference—the
license—between the two operating systems, with an elaborate spoof on
Microsoft's license explanation. 

Here is a list of a few of the new features that version 1.2 has, compared to
version 1.0:

    - Highly improved networking.
    - Faster disk I/O.
    - EIDE, multiple-IDE controllers, and ATA-CD-ROM support.
    - Supports more kinds of floppies, including 2.88 MB.
    - More CD-ROM devices supported.
    - Improved SCSI support, support for new SCSI adapter drivers.
    - Support for more network adapters.
    - New, improved memory management.
    - Multi-platform support underway.
    - UMSDOS filesystem: install Linux on DOS filesystem.
    - New sound driver supports Linux DOOM
    - Much, much more.
